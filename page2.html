            <p>Beckham made his first appearance for the England national football team on 1 September 1996, in a World
                Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[160]</p>
            <p>Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the
                England squad at the World Cup finals in France,[161] but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly
                accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,and he did not start in either of England's first two
                games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in
                a 2â€“0 victory, which was his first goal for England.</p>
            <p>In the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against
                Argentina.Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor,
                striking him on the calf muscle.[164] Sports Illustrated was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics in
                that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a "heavy-handed challenge" on Beckham and then "fell
                like a ton of bricks" when Beckham retaliated.Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off
                by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send
                Beckham off.The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many
                supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism
                and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a
                dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the
                World Cu.</p>
