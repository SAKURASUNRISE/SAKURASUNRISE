            <h1>Manchester United</h1>
            <p>Youth and early career</p>
            <p>Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,Beckham was part of a group of young
                players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached
                by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Known as the 'Class of '92', all
                six players came through Manchester United ranks together and went on to be teammates for over a
                decade.Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of
                the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full
                90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's
                impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a
                League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on
                23 January 1993.</p>

            <h1>Real Madrid</h1>
            <p>As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to
                Barcelona and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[65] but
                instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for €35 million on a four-year contract.Beckham
                was the latest signing in the Galácticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez
                every summer.The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who
                based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.Though announced in mid-June, the transfer
                was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club after Laurie
                Cunningham and Steve McManaman. </p>

            <h1>LA Galaxy</h1>
            <p>Beckham's involvement with Major League Soccer began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was
                confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy.
                The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's
                official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The announcement made top news all across the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the
                deal to be worth US$250 million,[90] the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR
                stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).</p>
