            <h1>LIFE</h1>
            <p>Beckham was born in Leytonstone, London, England.</p>
            <p>He regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary
                School and Chingford County High School. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school whenever the
                teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And
                they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to
                do." </p>
            <p>In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his
                parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.</p>
